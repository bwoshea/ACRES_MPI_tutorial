# IMPORTANT

These examples need Python (either 2.x or 3.x), mpi4py, and NumPy.
To access these on the MSU HPCC, log onto one of the development nodes
(e.g., dev-intel16).  Python 2.7.2 is loaded by default, but you can load
mpi4py and numpy by typing the following:

module load mpi4py
module load numpy

And everything should work.
