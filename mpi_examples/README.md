# IMPORTANT

These examples need Python, mpi4py, and NumPy.
To access these on the MSU HPCC, log onto one of the development nodes
(e.g., dev-intel14 or dev-intel16).  Python 2.7.2 is loaded by default, but you can load Python3, mpi4py, and numpy by typing the following:

```
module unload Python
module load Python3
module load mpi4py
module load numpy
```

And everything should work.
